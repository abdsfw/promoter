A new Flutter project.
###### note: This project is dedicated to the Emirati company Shamseen, so the files related to linking data and interfaces -state management files - will be deleted.

###### note: This project I created in partnership with a colleague in the company

## Getting Started

## What is the application?
This application is part of several integrated applications built for the Emirati company Shamseen, including: the management application, point of sale , the driver application, in addition to our application.

## Application description
This application is part of the Shamsin Company project, where the company produces food materials and is sold in schools in the Emirates, There are points of sale distributed among schools and 
each specific group is responsible for a promoter, The promoter can create or modify invoices instead of the point of sale, or see the inventory of the points of sale, or even know the amount of the sale by seeing the financial conditions of the points of sale.
